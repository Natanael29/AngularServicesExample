# RickAndMortyServicesExample

This project consists on a deployment of an Angular app in order to practice with Angular Services. Angular Services allow you to define code or functionalities that are accessible and reusable in other components in your project. In this example, we use The Rick And Morty API to get the data to later display into the views.
This API have data from characters, episodes and locations related to this series, so that to display this data, I created the three corresponding components (character, episode and location) and their services. This services have the functions to interact with each component, so for example, CharactersService get the data from the API related to characters.
In addition, it is used Angular Material for tables, grid lists and cards to get used to this library.
